﻿What My Program Does:

My program retrieves data from the New York Times API as I have coded the necessary parameters, the base URl, and other features to make the request. This data is for four bestseller lists of novels: hardcover fiction, hardcover non-fiction, e-book fiction, and e-book non-fiction. I am only looking at the top ten novels on each list. My program retrieves data for each list at a time. Once I get back the data, I have to perform several operations (iterating through the list and accumulating the name, making spaces between each word of the novel, etc) to just retrieve the novel name and in a format that will be able to be a query on twitter. Once this is done for each list, I save the name of the books in order of their position on the bestseller list into a big list. I have four lists now: novellist1, novellist2, novellist3, and novellist4. From there, I iterate through each of the novel lists and insert the name of each novel as a query. For each query, I make a request to the twitter API to return 25 tweets with the name of this novel in it. Overall, I will have 25 tweets for each 10 novels on each list of novels. I then combine all the tweets into a list for each bestseller list. I use defined classes and functions to then collect the emoscore, favorites counts, retweets counts, and the name of the novel for each tweet. In order to help viewers understand the general popularity of each novel, I sort the novels by their popularity in terms of average favorite and retweet counts for the novel’s set of tweets. I then write all this information to a CSV file so that I can open the data for each bestseller list in an excel file and analyze the data with the use of charts and graphs. I am attempting to analyze not only the average popularity, but if these features of its set of tweets correlate with the order of the 10 novels on each best seller list, indicating whether Twitter users agree with the general public that these bestselling books deserve to be on that list.
